# Explore Platform — Release Hardening (post-Phase 8)

This document tracks the final production-hardening pass for the Explore Platform.
It is the single source of truth for *what was actually verified* versus *what
remains a manual or blocked step*. Nothing here is marked done without evidence.

**Status labels** (used throughout):

- `Implemented` — code/artifact written and committed.
- `Unit test passed` — covered by `npm test` and passing.
- `Live DB verified` — run against the real Supabase project, results recorded.
- `Browser verified` — exercised through Playwright/real browser.
- `Smoke-tested` — confirmed against production/preview by a human.
- `Manual step pending` — requires a human action (add secret, apply migration, run SQL).
- `Blocked` — cannot be done from this environment; reason recorded.

## 0. Baseline (recorded 2026-06-22)

| Item | Value / Result |
|---|---|
| Git root | `web/` (repo), remote `origin` = github.com/Quan8362/chococfko |
| Branch | `main` |
| HEAD | `ec65582` — feat(explore): Phase 8 hardening + discovery-controls UI/UX refactor |
| Remote sync | In sync with `origin/main` (0 ahead / 0 behind) |
| Working tree | Only **untracked Japanese-learning** files (`data/japanese/examples-n3-*`, worklist) — explicitly excluded from this work |
| Next.js | 14.2.35 (App Router) |
| Node | v24.15.0 |
| Package manager | npm (package-lock.json) |
| Scripts | `dev build start`, `lint` (=`next lint`), `test` (=`node --test "lib/**/*.test.ts"`) |
| Unit tests | **324 pass / 0 fail** (`npm test`) — recorded baseline |
| Type check | see §27 (run during this pass) |
| Production build | see §31 |
| CI workflows | **none** (`.github/workflows` empty) |
| ESLint config | **none present** (`next lint` would prompt to set up) |
| Playwright | config + `e2e/jp60.spec.ts` exist; `@playwright/test` **not installed** |
| Cron endpoint | `app/api/cron/return-user/route.ts` — guarded by `CRON_SECRET`; **no `vercel.json` schedule** |
| Rate limiting | only `lib/japanese/rateLimit.ts` (in-memory, per-instance) — **no distributed/DB limiter** |
| Analytics | `analytics_events` (user_id, anonymous_visitor_id, session_id, path, locale, metadata, created_at) |

### Release gates after this hardening pass (run locally 2026-06-22)

| Gate | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Unit tests | `npm test` | **344 pass / 0 fail** (was 324; +20 new: rate-limit 13, cron 7) |
| Type check | `npm run typecheck` | **pass** (exit 0) |
| ESLint (full) | `npm run lint` | **0 errors**, 31 warnings (legacy, non-blocking) |
| ESLint (explore) | `npm run lint:explore` | **exit 0** |
| i18n parity | `npm run i18n:check` | **OK — 3707 keys × 5 locales** |
| Production build | `npm run build` | **success** (exit 0); `/map` is route-split (56.6 kB), not on `/` |

## §3 — Schema verification

`supabase/verify_explore_platform_schema.sql` is a **read-only** script. It checks
existence and shape of every Explore object (tables, columns, views, functions,
triggers, RLS-enabled state, policy counts) and prints a PASS/FAIL row per object.
It performs **no writes** and touches **no production content**.

> **Manual step pending:** run the script in the Supabase SQL Editor (or `psql`)
> against the production project and paste the result table back here. Until then
> this item is `Implemented` only — **not** `Live DB verified`.

## §4 — Live RLS verification — Blocked

A live RLS suite requires a throwaway Supabase project (or local `supabase start`)
with two seeded test users and the service-role key. Neither a local Supabase nor a
non-production service key is available in this environment, and running RLS probes
against the production project with real users is unsafe. The verification SQL (§3)
asserts RLS-enabled + policy presence statically; full per-user allow/deny probing
is documented as the next manual step. Do **not** report RLS as live-verified yet.

## §5 — ESLint gate

- `.eslintrc.json` extends `next/core-web-vitals` + registers `@typescript-eslint`
  (so legacy inline `no-explicit-any` disables resolve) with pragmatic, non-noisy rules.
- Ignores build output, generated files, data artifacts, python `scripts/`, SQL.
- Scripts: `lint` (full), `lint:explore` (lib + Explore/Admin routes).
- **Result:** `npm run lint` → **0 errors**, 31 warnings; `npm run lint:explore` → **exit 0**.
- One real finding fixed: `PlacesExplorer.tsx` had an imperative geolocation handler
  named `useMyLocation` called inside an `onClick`, which tripped `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks`.
  Renamed to `requestMyLocation` (it calls no hooks — the name was misleading).
- Remaining 31 **warnings** (non-blocking, legacy): 18 `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`,
  12 `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`, 1 `@next/next/no-page-custom-font`. Triaged as
  low-risk; not auto-"fixed" to avoid behavioural changes to unrelated code.

## §10 — Cron & notification dedup

- `vercel.json` adds a conservative schedule for `/api/cron/return-user`.
- `migration_notification_delivery_log.sql` adds an idempotent delivery-log table keyed
  by `(user_id, type, entity_key, window_key)` with a unique constraint, so the same
  reminder window can never be delivered twice even across instances/retries.
- The route now: validates `Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}` (constant-time-ish compare, never
  logs the secret), bounds work, isolates per-recipient failures, dedups via the log,
  and returns an execution summary.
- Pure helpers (window-key derivation, JST date, dedup decision) are unit-tested.

> **Manual steps pending:** (a) add `CRON_SECRET` in Vercel project env; (b) apply
> `migration_notification_delivery_log.sql`.

## §11 — Rate limiting

- `migration_rate_limits.sql` adds `rate_limit_hits` (atomic fixed-window counter,
  keyed by a privacy-preserving subject hash, never raw IP) + an atomic
  `rate_limit_hit(...)` SQL function and a cleanup helper.
- `lib/rateLimitDb.ts` wraps the function with typed limits per action and a localized
  error shape; falls back safely (fail-open with logging) if the DB is unreachable so a
  limiter outage never hard-breaks UX.
- Pure policy logic (limit table, subject keying, decision) is unit-tested.

> **Manual step pending:** apply `migration_rate_limits.sql`.

## §12 — Analytics retention/session — Designed, partially blocked

`analytics_events` already carries `anonymous_visitor_id` + `session_id` + `user_id`
+ `created_at`, which is enough to compute D1/D7 *forward-looking* cohorts and
useful-action session completion **from the deploy date onward** (no historical
backfill — that would be fabrication). A daily-rollup migration + admin-only read is
the intended implementation; it is documented here and deferred rather than emitting
fabricated historical retention. Dashboard should show "data available from <date>".

## §13 — Performance — Blocked (measurement)

Lighthouse / real traces require a running or deployed instance and a controlled
network profile. This environment cannot run the app headless reliably, so numbers
are **not** recorded. Budgets are documented in `explore-platform-production-smoke-test.md`
for a human to fill from a Vercel preview. Static wins already in place are noted there.

## §16 — Security review (summary)

Reviewed: cron auth (secret-gated, no logging), service-role usage (server-only files),
share-token read-only paths, URL validation, CSV/calendar injection in exports,
personalization privacy (no private notes/participant names in "why am I seeing this").
Concrete additive fixes shipped this pass: DB-backed rate limiting on abuse-prone
writes, delivery-log dedup (prevents notification spam), health endpoint leaks nothing.
Any further confirmed high-severity items are listed in the final report.

## Manual / blocked actions required to reach PRODUCTION VERIFIED

1. Apply migrations (order in final report): `migration_rate_limits.sql`,
   `migration_notification_delivery_log.sql`.
2. Run `verify_explore_platform_schema.sql`; paste results.
3. Add `CRON_SECRET` to Vercel env.
4. Run an RLS probe suite against a test project.
5. Install Playwright browsers in CI/preview and run the critical suite.
6. Capture Lighthouse mobile+desktop on a preview deployment.
7. Complete `explore-platform-production-smoke-test.md` against production.
